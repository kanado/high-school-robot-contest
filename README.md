## Specification
- Main microcontroller
  - Arduino MEGA(main)
  - Arduino UNO(sub) 

- Motor driver
  - [6CH motor controller](https://www.daisen-netstore.com/shopdetail/000000000074/ct12/page1/order/)
  from DAISEN Electronics Industry Co.<br>
  â€»Operation may vary depending on the version of the chip installed.

- Compass sensor
  - [9D Compass(BNO055)](https://www.daisen-netstore.com/shopdetail/000000000093/ct11/page1/order/)
  from DAISEN Electronics Industry Co.
 
- Ultrasonic distance sensor
  - [Ultrasonic distance sensor](https://www.daisen-netstore.com/shopdetail/000000000226/ct11/page1/order/)
  from Parallax
  
- Color camera sensor
  - [Pixy (CMUcam5)](https://docs.pixycam.com/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:v1:start) <br>
  Pixy (CMUcam5) is a good choice for Pixy2, as few places are handling it now.
  
- Air hand
<br>The opening and closing of the solenoid valve is controlled by a relay.
  - The air hand is a [thin air chuck (MHF2)](https://www.smcworld.com/webcatalog/ja-jp/rotary-actuators-air-grippers/parallel-type-air-grippers/)
 made by SMC.
  - Solenoid valve is [030-4E1 DC12V](https://official.koganei.co.jp/product/030_ALL) 
 made by Koganei.
  
- MicroSwitch
<br>Microswitches were used as contact sensors.  
  - [Microswitch (D2VW-5L1-1M) manufactured](https://www.fa.omron.co.jp/product/item/62299/) by OMRON
 
- Rotary Encoder 
<br>The rotary encoder was used to obtain self-position.
  - [Incremental, Resolution 360 P/R, 25 mm-dia(E6A2-CW3C 360P/R 0.5M)](https://www.fa.omron.co.jp/product/item/2348/en/) by OMRON
